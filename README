NOTE: THIS CODE DOES NOT DO MUCH YET. THIS FILE WILL BE CHANGED WHEN
THE CODE IS TESTABLE.

I began this project guessing that all of the necessary bluetooth
information would be passed to the level where an xorg module could
use it. This is not the case and I am currently working on getting
all of the touch data from the mouse. For those of you githubbers (and
any others) interested in helping out, please meet in #magicmouse on
irc.freenode.net.
